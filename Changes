Version 0.6-0
  
  *   Clearer error message if uploadDoc() fails at the server end.

  *   Allow caller to specify type AsIs (type = I(value)) in uploadDoc() to avoid
      interpreting by RGoogleDocs. Google Docs itself still checks the type is valid.

  *   Updated the URLs to 'https'.

  *   searchDocs() can handle text or binary response to query.

Version 0.5-0

  *   uploadDoc() now has a replace parameter which, if TRUE, causes any existing documenting
      with the same name to be replaced by the new document, if the upload is successful.
      (Raised on StackOverflow, March 4 2011.)
  
  *   deleteDoc() now has methods for handling lists, document names, document URLs and
      document description objects (returned from getDocs()).

  *   deleteDoc() can compute its own connection if the GoogleDocsPassword option is set.

  *   Method for [ for GoogleDocList so that the result is also a GoogleDocList.

  *   deleteDoc() sets its own writefunction which modifies the curl handle.
      This is due to crashes when this is not set on cloned/duplicated curl handles.


Version 0.4-1

  *  Updated for what seems to be a change on the server for reading spreadsheets.

Version 0.4-0
  
  *  Added the ability to read public spreadsheets.

  *  Introduced unauthenticated connection class for dealing with public documents.

  *  Generalized getting a cell's value which had meant omitting some values.

Version 0.3-0

  *  Added the ability to upload to a folder.


Version 0.2-3

  *   Added followlocation = TRUE to getURL() calls to handle "Moved temporarily".
  
Version 0.2-2

  *   Changed sheetAsMatrix() to use processCells2() (rather than processCells()).

  *   Updates to run.xml documentation/vignette to reflect new function names.

Version 0.2-1

  *   Simple bug when setting the access slot in getXMLDocEntryInfo() via getDocs()
      when there is no feedLink in the returned XML description. 

Version 0.2-0

  *  Added documentation for R functions.

  *  Added classes to differentiate between word processing and spreadsheet documents

  *  Facilities for getting the worksheets in a spreadsheet and their contents:
      getSheets(), as(sheet, "matrix"), sheetAsMatrix()

  *  getGoogleAuth() and getConnection() now more aware of the different services (writely and wise)
     and the latter returns an object of a class corresponding to the particular service.

  *  Many, many more...  See run.xml
